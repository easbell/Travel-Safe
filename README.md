## About this Project
  The idea of this project came about when preparing for international travel. I realized that in order to find saftey information and vaccine information, I had to go to multiple sites. TravelSafe solves this problem by pulling in the [Travel Advisory](https://www.travel-advisory.info/) API and combining the data with relevant vaccine information.
